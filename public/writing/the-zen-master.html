			The Zen Master
		</h1>
    <p>
      The master and his student were sitting on tatami mats, eating bowls of noodles.
    </p>
    <p>
    	&ldquo;What is the path to enlightenment?&rdquo; asked the student.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The master slurped up the last of his noodles. He focused his eyes on the far wall.
    </p>
    <p>
    	&ldquo;Suppose a man...&rdquo; said the Zen master.
    </p>
    <p>
    	He was interrupted by the ringing of a cell phone.
    </p>
    <p>
    	&ldquo;Hold that thought,&rdquo; said the Zen master.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The master pulled his cell phone out of the folds of his fine robes and left through the sliding paper door. He never returned.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The student held that thought for thirty-three years, sitting and sleeping on the tatami mat, eating bowls of noodles, supposing a man. In the thirty-third year, he was enlightened.
