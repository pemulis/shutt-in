<h1 id='top'>Hello!</h1>

<p>I'm John Shutt, a writer and technologist based in Las Vegas, NV.

Right now I'm working on smart contract applications at Risk Labs, which supports the UMA and Across protocols. I've done some <a href='/writing'>writing</a> and <a href='http://allcity.news'>investigative reporting</a>, startup consulting, and hackerspace volunteering at <a href='https://noisebridge.net/'>Noisebridge</a>.
