<p>Hey! I'm a writer and technology person based in San Francisco.

Right now I'm focused on <a href='/writing'>freelance reporting</a>, running <a href='https://bayleaks.org'>BayLeaks</a>, and helping out at <a href='https://noisebridge.net/'>Noisebridge</a>. You can find me on <a href='https://twitter.com/jdshutt'>Twitter</a> or <a href='mailto:jds@riseup.net'>send me an email</a> if you want to get in touch.</p>
