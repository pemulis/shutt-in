<h1 id='top'>Hello!</h1>

<p>I'm John Shutt, a writer and technologist based in Las Vegas, NV. I've worked on a lot of projects over the years, <a href='/resume'>some of them professional</a> and many <a href='/coding'>just for fun</a>. Right now I'm working on Oya, a crypto account protocol. Previously, I worked on smart contract applications at Risk Labs, which built the UMA and Across protocols. I've done some <a href='/writing'>writing</a> and investigative reporting, startup consulting, and hackerspace volunteering at <a href='https://noisebridge.net/'>Noisebridge</a>. You can reach me by <a href='mailto:john.d.shutt@gmail.com'>email</a> if you want to get in touch.</p>
