# This is my homepage 

This used to be a Rails app, when I was first learning that framework. I'm moving it over to GitHub Pages, which is a way better modern fit for what I'm trying to do here.

Right now http://shutt.in has the Rails version, and https://pemulis.github.io/shutt-in has the GitHub Pages version. Soon the GitHub Pages version will be complete and I can make the DNS changes.
