      When your mother died, you inherited her house. You sit in the house with the heat off and your overcoat on and watch VHS tapes. You walk along the fence of the country club and pick up golf balls that sliced. You go to afternoon mass with pockets full of golf balls. There are thousands of golf balls in trash bins behind your house. Ask, why do you keep them there? And respond, you don't know what to do with them.
